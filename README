What has been implemented?
        - README
        - compress40.c and compress40.h: To call all the functions with the 
                implemetations of the compress40 and decompress40. Does all the 
                heavy work of the compression and decompression
        - bitpack.c and bitpack.h: The implemenation of the bit manipulation 
        functions needed for the compress40.h.
        - compress_helper.c: Has the implementation of the helper functions for 
        the conversions of the RGB to component video and viceversa, DCT 
        conversion 
        
Acknowledgements:
        - We received help from TA's. 
        - We also used Hanson's book to check for the relevant data structures 
        and interfaces to use in our design.

We believe that we have implemented the compressor correctly but the 
decompressor has a bit of an issue as it prints out some grreen sections in 
in place of white and black.  Also Bitpack_gets function are not 
fuly correctly functional in Bitpack.

Time spent: We estimate to have spent approximately 50 hours on this
homework.
